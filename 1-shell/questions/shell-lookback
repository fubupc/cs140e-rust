Q: Your shell makes use of much of the code youâ€™ve written. Briefly explain: which pieces does it makes use of and in what way?

A: It uses:
- `pi::uart` and `kernel::console` to receive input and echo back
- `stack_vec::StackVec` to store received input characters and command parse results in stack-allocated memory.
