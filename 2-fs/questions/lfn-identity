Q: Given the bytes for a directory entry, how, precisely, do you determine whether the entry is an LFN entry or a regular directory entry? Be specific about which bytes you read and what their values should be.

A: Read the byte at offset 11, if it's 0xFF then this is a LFN entry, otherwise a regular directory entry.
